### FAQ:

> What's the difference between Linkart from Constellation and Linkart Refabricated?

This is just an up to date version of that mod, so it will be the same besides ports and bugfixes (except for the config library, which was changed to MidnightLib as Dark Matter is archived too, also giving ModMenu integration in the process)


> How do I link minecarts together?

Just get a bunch of chains and SHIFT + RMB on your “parent” cart, and then SHIFT + RMB again on your “child” cart. Now the child cart will follow its parent!

> Forge version?

Not by me. Although 1.20 version of the original mod works with Sinytra Connector, so you may as well try.
